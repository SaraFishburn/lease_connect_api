## Dataflow Diagram

The following diagram outlines the flow and storage of data throughout the application. All data flow begins with the action of an external entity which in this case is a user of the application. The user action triggers a process on the front end that in turn activates a process on the backend server via a request to the backend API. The server then queries or stores data in the database and sends a response back to the frontend where appropriate.
